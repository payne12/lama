# The LAMA Laboratory

Welcome to the **Language, Attention, Memory, and Aging (LAMA) Laboratory** at the University of Utah.

## Research

Research in the LAMA lab, housed in the [Department of Psychology](http://psych.utah.edu) at the University of Utah, is centered on understanding the nature of language and memory systems across the adult lifespan, how these systems are modulated by attention, and how these sytems are functionally organized within the human brain. Our lab adopts an interdisciplinary and multi-method approach to this work, merging theoretical models from the cognitive sciences, gerontology, neuroscience, linguistics, and quantitative and experimental psychology, as well as a range of methods (experimental, correlational, and longitudinal) and measures of brain activity (e.g., event-related brain potentials [ERPs]), performance (eye-tracking, reaction time, memory performance), and physiology (e.g., pupillary response).
